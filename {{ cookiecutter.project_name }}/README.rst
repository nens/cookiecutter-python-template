{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
==========================================

Introduction

Usage, etc.


Installation
------------

We can be installed with::

  $ pip install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

(TODO: after the first release has been made)


Development installation of this project itself
-----------------------------------------------

We use python's build-in "virtualenv" to get a nice isolated directory. You
only need to run this once::

  $ python3 -m venv .

A virtualenv puts its commands in the ``bin`` directory. So ``bin/pip``,
``bin/pytest``, etc. Set up the dependencies like this::

  $ bin/pip install -e .[test]

There will be a script you can run like this::

  $ bin/run-{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

It runs the `main()` function in `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/scripts.py`,
adjust that if necessary. The script is configured in `setup.py` (see
`entry_points`).

In order to get nicely formatted python files without having to spend manual
work on it, get `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ and install it on this project::

  $ pre-commit install

Run the tests regularly with coverage::

  $ bin/pytest --cov

The tests are also run automatically `on "github actions"
<https://githug.com/nens/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/actions>`_ for
"main" and for pull requests. So don't just make a branch, but turn it into
a pull request right away:

- On your pull request page, you also automatically get the feedback from the
  automated tests.

If you need a new dependency (like ``requests``), add it in ``pyproject.toml`` in
``dependencies``. And update your local install with::

  $ bin/pip install -e .[test]


Steps to do after generating with cookiecutter
----------------------------------------------

- Add a new project on https://github.com/nens/ with the same name. Think about
  the visibility to ("public" / "private") and do not generate a license or readme.

  Note: "public" means "don't put customer data or sample data with real
  persons' addresses on github"!

- Follow the steps you then see (from "git init" to "git push origin main")
  and your code will be online.

- Go to
  https://github.com/nens/{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/settings/collaboration
  and add the teams with write access (you might have to ask someone with
  admin rights (like Reinout) to do it).

- Update this readme. Use `.rst
  <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ as the format.

- Remove this section as you've done it all :-)
